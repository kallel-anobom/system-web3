# About The Project
This project aims to explore web3 technologies by developing a smart contract and a web application that integrates with MetaMask to simulate cryptocurrency donations."

## What is a Smart Contract?
A smart contract is a computer program that automatically executes, controls, or documents events and actions according to the terms of a contract or agreement. These contracts are stored and executed on a blockchain, which is a distributed ledger technology.

### Key Features of a Smart Contract:
* Autonomy: Once deployed, a smart contract operates independently, without the need for human intervention.
* Security: Due to the nature of blockchain, smart contracts are difficult to hack or manipulate.
* Transparency: All terms and conditions of a smart contract are publicly visible and auditable on the blockchain.
* Immutability: Once created, the code of a smart contract cannot be altered, ensuring that the terms cannot be changed without consensus.
* Efficiency: Reduces the need for intermediaries, speeding up processes and reducing costs.
